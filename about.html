        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p class="para">
            I work as a full-time, freelance illustrator and have been able to travel the 
            world while supporting myself through my art. Over the last two years I’ve spent
             time traveling through Iceland in a camper van and cozied up in a studio apartment in Karnataka. 
             I’ve bopped all over  karnataka and lived more van-life adventures cruising around Maharashtra. 
             I’ve had more oat-milk lattes then I can count and have spent many late nights working from the road, 
             and have plenty of things to share from these experiences. A travel blog seemed like an inevitable next step!

        <h2>What to Expect From This Travel Blog
        </h2>
        <p class="para1">
            I’ll be sharing places I find – of course – as well as travel tips, recommendations, ideas + more!
             I also want to tap into my artistic side and share advice, ideas, and recommendations for the fellow creative
             as well! We’re all multi-faceted humans with lots of interests, so why not get into it all!
             I’m very excited and eager to start writing and sharing on this blog and I hope you’ll join me for the journey!
        </p>
